My Portfolio

This is a webpage to display personal projects for recruiters, employers, etc.
The webpage has been developed with HTML5, CSS, and Javascript, and uses external
libraries such as jQuery, MagicScroll, and Animate on Scroll. All code is
available under The MIT License (MIT). I expect to complete development of this
webpage by July 1st, 2020. More documentation is coming soon.

Happy coding!

Austin
